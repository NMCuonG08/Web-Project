Everything changed when a woman sat next to him at the poker table\" was written by 6 on Fri Dec 20 2024 22:10:28 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time) and published on Thu Dec 26 2024 12:34:21 GMT+0700 (Indochina Time). It is not a premium article in the category \"Health\". The main content is: When Englishman Francis Chadwick decided to spend Christmas in Las Vegas, his goal was simply to escape everything.It was 2014. Francis was 34 and in the middle of a divorce.“I just wanted to get away,” Francis tells CNN Travel today. “Christmas being, obviously, quite a family orientated time of year I didn’t want to be around anything Christmassy. I was like, ‘Where’s the least Christmassy place I could go to?’ Vegas seemed like the place.”So while his family and friends were spending evenings enjoying festive drinks, decorating Christmas trees and watching “Love Actually,” Francis packed his bag, leaving his Christmas sweater behind, and headed to the United States.“I was in Washington, D.C., for a couple of days. I went to Dallas for a few days, watched the Cowboys down there, and then on to Vegas over the Christmas period,” recalls Francis. “And my mindset at the time — I had no interest in women, relationships, anything at — I hadn’t even contemplated a relationship since the separation from my first wife.”On Christmas Eve 2014, Francis was playing three-card poker at Vegas’ MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, a sweeping, vast gambling palace on the Vegas Strip.He was pretty absorbed in the game when a woman sat down next to Francis, and he looked up.The woman smiled widely, introducing herself as Tehzin from Toronto. Then, Tehzin introduced Francis to what seemed like her entire family, who all appeared to be in tow. Subsequently, Tehzin’s sister and brother-in-law sat down at the poker table next to her.“So, how do we play?” Tehzin asked Francis, smiling again.Francis didn’t know what to think. All he knew was he was drawn to Tehzin. Slowly, surprising himself, he smiled back. It felt like the first time he’d smiled properly in months.Francis didn’t — at that point — know the significance of this moment.“You’ve got me traveling to Vegas from the UK, Tehzin traveling there from Canada… What are the chances that we would actually cross paths at all, let alone everything else that happened next? It’s pretty crazy,” says Francis today.Tehzin from TorontoWhen Tehzin from Toronto crossed paths with Francis that December 2014, she was also in her mid-30s.“I was at the point in my life where all of my friends and a lot of members of my family were around my age, and already were in relationships or married. A lot of them were having kids and moving on in their lives — in the best way possible. And I kind of felt left behind because I didn’t find anybody by that time,” Tehzin tells CNN Travel today.“I kind of had given up on the idea that I was going to meet anybody, and I was thinking that train had passed, and I just missed it …”When Tehzin was in her 20s and would go on trips and travel to new places, she’d always wonder in the back of her mind whether she might meet someone significant.But by the time Tehzin traveled to Vegas, at age 34, she’d stopped thinking that was a possibility. Instead, she was simply looking forward to the family time.“I was there with my whole family — my extended family, my parents, my sisters, my brother-in-law,” Tehzin recalls. “We all had time off during the holiday season and decided to go on a family trip.”Tehzin’s family chose Vegas because of the warm weather, short flight time and potential for fun activities. While Tehzin doesn’t gamble, she says most of her family enjoys “occasional gambling at the casino.”“I remember going on this trip and not even taking any makeup with me or anything. I was thinking, ‘I’m just there with my family, and we’re just going to hang out,’” Tehzin recalls. “And that’s when I met Francis…”You’ve got me traveling to Vegas from the UK, Tehzin traveling there from Canada… What are the chances that we would actually cross paths at all, let alone everything else that happened next? It’s pretty crazy.Francis ChadwickThat Christmas Eve, Tehzin and her family were walking through the MGM casino after dinner and Tehzin’s family kept encouraging her to try her hand at gambling.“They would stop at a table, explain the game, and the rules of the game, say, ‘OK, what do you think about this table?’ And I’d be like, ‘No, I don’t like this game. Let’s move on.’ Then we finally got to this three-card poker table, which is where Francis was sitting …”Tehzin noticed Francis right away.“Instantly, obviously,” she says, laughing. “He’s a very handsome man. I was like, ‘Oh, I have a good feeling about this table.’”After Tehzin introduced herself, her brother-in-law attempted to guide her through the poker.“I’m not listening to him because I’m too busy staring at Francis, and so I’m losing all sorts of money because I’m not paying attention to what’s going on here,” recalls Tehzin, laughing. “But I started chatting with Francis — or flirting with Francis — and we were there for hours, four hours maybe, at the table together.”Tehzin doesn’t drink, but she’s naturally outgoing and sociable. Francis is usually a little more reserved and quiet, but “he was drinking, so he was more talkative,” as Tehzin puts it.“And he had this lovely British accent,” she adds.In between discussing poker rules, Tehzin and Francis did a lot of joking back and forth about UK words and phrases.“That was a good icebreaker,” says Tehzin.But while Tehzin was enjoying Francis’ company, she kept thinking: “He’s too handsome to be here on Christmas Eve on his own, I’m going to get in trouble. Some girl’s going to come and be like, ‘What are you doing, partying with my man?’”“I just met you. I don’t know you …”Eventually, after losing yet another game, Tehzin decided to cut her losses — in more ways than one. She got up to go, said goodbye to Francis and the rest of the people at the table. Her brother and sister-in-law followed.Throughout their time at the poker table, Francis had found himself drawn to Tehzin. He liked her smile, liked her laugh, enjoyed their easy repartee. But he wasn’t looking for romance, and didn’t let himself even consider the prospect.But as Tehzin got up to leave, one of the other people on the table — an American guy who was there with his wife and had joined in with some of the joking back and forth — nudged Francis.“He said, ‘You should go after her,’” recalls Francis. “And something in my head just sort of clicked. I thought, ‘I should.’ So I did. I got up from the table, and I caught up with Tehzin and tapped her on the shoulder.”Tehzin looked surprised but happy to see Francis.“She turned around like, ‘Oh!’ And I said, ‘What are you up to? Do you want to get a drink?’” recalls Francis today. “She agreed. And we took things from there.”Sitting at the bar, just the two of them, Tehzin and Francis talked in more depth.Francis, aware there was something between them, felt the desire to be honest about his divorce.“I told her my life story,” he says. “That I was separated — technically still married, but there was no chance of reconciliation or anything there.”Francis also told Tehzin he was a smoker and absolutely obsessed with American football — more than slightly drunk at this point, Francis felt he needed to run through any potential offputting things about him.“And I’m thinking, ‘I just met you. I don’t know you. I don’t think I’m ever going to see you after today. Why are you telling me all this?’” recalls Tehzin.“But I just found him to be so different from other men that I had gone on dates with, because he was so honest and clear and direct. And I found that to be different, but in a charming way. Later I found out that he’s just an extraordinarily honest person, to a fault, he is extraordinarily honest and just wants to be really clear. But at that point I was just like, ‘Oh, how endearing. Crazy, but endearing.’”In the lead up to Francis’ visit, Tehzin surprised herself by not feeling any hint of nerves.“I was just super excited,” she says. “But then when I was telling my friends about it, they were like, “This guy, you don’t know anything about him.’ My family and my friends. They were all like, ‘You don’t know anything about this guy.’ So they’re all Googling, searching for anything they can find on Francis.”“That noise … I listened to it. But I just kind of put it to the corner a little bit, because I don’t know. I just had a good feeling. And sometimes you’ve got to go with your gut. I was just excited to see him. I thought we’d chat, we would use the opportunity to get to know each other better and decide what was going on.”Francis was equally excited to see Tehzin again. And his friends and family were all encouraging.“They were really happy for me, because I had been sort of pretty down that year, since separating from my first wife,” he says. “And after Tehzin and I met, in order to be able to move on, I went to counseling to help me with getting through the whole emotional aspect of going through a divorce, and being able to move past that. My friends and family were all very happy with the fact I was moving on with my life.”While Tehzin’s friends were a little apprehensive, they were also looking forward to checking out Francis for themself.After she’d described him — “tall, very handsome, beautiful eyes” — Tehzin’s friends had jokingly nicknamed Francis “The Dream.”“Then we all started calling him The Dream,” says Tehzin, laughing. “They didn’t know his name for the longest time. They just called him The Dream for the longest time.”Tehzin put together a packed Toronto itinerary for Francis, including time with her loved ones and a day trip to Niagara Falls.“I organized who he was going to meet, where we were going to go, which places for brunch and dinner. And I had all my outfits planned for every day. I was super excited,” she says.“And then when we met again, it was just so easy, comfortable.”“It was all pretty comfortable, easy,” agrees Francis. “We had a great time.”."
